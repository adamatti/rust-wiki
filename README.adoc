Same old https://github.com/adamatti/wiki[wiki], but using https://www.rust-lang.org/[rust lang].

This is my first project using rust, so it probably doesn't follow the best practices. Be aware of it ðŸ˜Š

==== Features

* Add/update/remove items with markdown, persisted on mongo
* Security - single user, need to provider user/pass as env vars
* Functional tests - mongo needs to be running, docker-compose provided
* Ready to deploy to heroku - need to provide env vars:
** APP_PASS
** APP_USER
** MONGODB_DATABASE
** MONGODB_PASS
** MONGODB_URI
** MONGODB_USER
** RUST_BACKTRACE = full (optional)
** RUSTUP_TOOLCHAIN = nightly

==== Missing items

* feature: tags
* feature: search
* http://asciidoc.org/[asciidoc] - there is no cargo implementation today
* https://redis.io/[redis] - parse is not slow as java to use cache, but I would like to play with it.
* test coverage report
* Dockerfile - why? to deploy to kubernetes
